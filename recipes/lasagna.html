    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    1 pound sweet Italian sausage<br>

    ¾ pound lean ground beef<br>

    ½ cup minced onion<br>

    2 cloves garlic, crushed<br>

    1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes<br>

    2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste<br>

    2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce<br>

    ½ cup water<br>

    2 tablespoons white sugar<br>

    1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves<br>

    ½ teaspoon fennel seeds<br>

    1 teaspoon Italian seasoning<br>

    1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste<br>

    ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper<br>

    4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br>

    12 lasagna noodles<br>

    16 ounces ricotta cheese<br>

    1 egg<br>

    ¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced<br>

    ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>

    <h2>Step One</h2>

    In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.<br> 
    Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.<br>
    Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

    <h2>Step Two</h2>

    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br> 
    Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
    Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. <br>
    In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

    <h2>Step Three</h2>

    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

    <h2>Step Four</h2>

    To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.<br> 
    Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.<br> 
    Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture.<br>
    Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices.<br> 
    Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.<br> 
    Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.<br> 
    Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.

    <h2>Step Five</h2>

    Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.<br> 
    Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes.<br> 
    Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
