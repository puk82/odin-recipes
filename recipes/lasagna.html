    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li><br>

    <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li><br>

    <li>½ cup minced onion</li><br>

    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li><br>

    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li><br>

    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li><br>

    <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li><br>

    <li>½ cup water</li><br>

    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li><br>

    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li><br>

    <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li><br>

    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li><br>

    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li><br>

    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li><br>

    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li><br>

    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li><br>

    <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li><br>

    <li>1 egg</li><br>

    <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li><br>

    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li><br>

    <h2>Step One</h2>

    In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.<br> 
    Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.<br>
    Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

    <h2>Step Two</h2>

    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br> 
    Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
    Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. <br>
    In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

    <h2>Step Three</h2>

    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

    <h2>Step Four</h2>

    To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.<br> 
    Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.<br> 
    Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture.<br>
    Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices.<br> 
    Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.<br> 
    Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.<br> 
    Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.

    <h2>Step Five</h2>

    Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.<br> 
    Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes.<br> 
    Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
